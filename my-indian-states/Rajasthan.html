    <h2>The Rich History of Rajasthan</h2>
    
    <p>Rajasthan, literally meaning "Land of Kings," has a fascinating history spanning several millennia:</p>
    
    <h3>Ancient Period</h3>
    <p>Archaeological evidence suggests human settlements in Rajasthan date back to the Indus Valley Civilization (3300-1300 BCE). Kalibangan in northern Rajasthan was an important provincial center of the civilization. The region was part of various ancient kingdoms and republics mentioned in Mahabharata and Buddhist literature.</p>
    
    <h3>Medieval Era and Rajput Kingdoms</h3>
    <p>The medieval period saw the rise of powerful Rajput clans such as the Chauhans, Paramaras, Guhilas, Sisodiyas, Rathores, and Kachchwahas, who established various kingdoms across the region. The Rajputs became known for their fierce independence, martial valor, and chivalric code.</p>
    
    <p>Notable Rajput kingdoms included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mewar (Udaipur):</strong> Ruled by the Sisodiyas, known for rulers like Maharana Pratap who resisted Mughal dominance</li>
        <li><strong>Marwar (Jodhpur):</strong> Established by the Rathore clan</li>
        <li><strong>Amber/Jaipur:</strong> Founded by the Kachchwahas who formed close alliances with the Mughals</li>
        <li><strong>Bikaner:</strong> Another Rathore kingdom established in the arid northwestern region</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Mughal Period</h3>
    <p>The 16th century marked the expansion of Mughal influence in Rajasthan. Emperor Akbar established matrimonial alliances with several Rajput houses, incorporating them into the imperial administration. However, some kingdoms like Mewar under Maharana Pratap (1572-1597) fiercely resisted Mughal domination. The blend of Rajput and Mughal cultures led to remarkable developments in architecture, art, and cuisine.</p>
    
    <h3>Maratha Influence and British Era</h3>
    <p>As Mughal power declined in the 18th century, Maratha influence grew in Rajasthan. Eventually, most Rajput states signed subsidiary alliances with the British East India Company, maintaining their internal autonomy while acknowledging British suzerainty. Unlike many other regions of India, most of Rajasthan remained under indirect rule through princely states rather than direct British administration.</p>
    
    <h3>Post-Independence Era</h3>
    <p>After India's independence in 1947, the process of integrating the princely states began. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India's first Deputy Prime Minister, played a crucial role in this process. The Rajputana Agency was reorganized as Rajasthan state in stages, culminating in the Greater Rajasthan in 1956 with Jaipur as its capital.</p>
