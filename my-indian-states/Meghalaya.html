        <h2>History of Meghalaya</h2>
        <p>
            Meghalaya, meaning "Abode of Clouds," is a state in northeastern India known for its rich cultural heritage and natural beauty. The region was historically inhabited by the Khasi, Jaintia, and Garo tribes, each with its unique traditions and governance systems. During British rule, Meghalaya was part of Assam and played a significant role in trade and administration. It became a separate state in 1972, preserving its distinct identity and traditions.
