    <h2>History of Kerala</h2>
    <p>
      Kerala, located on the southwestern coast of India, has a rich and diverse history that dates back over 3,000 years.
      The region was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans, who traded spices such as black pepper and cardamom.
      Kerala was influenced by a variety of cultures and religions including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chera dynasty was one of the earliest rulers of Kerala, followed by various local feudal lords. During the medieval period,
      the arrival of Arab traders and later the Portuguese, Dutch, and British shaped its maritime culture.
      Kerala was formed as a state in 1956, uniting the Malayalam-speaking regions.
