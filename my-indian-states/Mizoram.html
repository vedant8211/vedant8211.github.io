<h2>üó∫Ô∏è History of Mizoram</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Mizoram is a beautiful state located in the northeastern part of India.</li>
    <li>It is home to the Mizo people, who originally migrated from the Chin Hills (in present-day Myanmar) between the 16th and 18th centuries.</li>
    <li>These hill tribes had their own unique traditions, languages, and way of life.</li>
    <li>During British rule, the region was brought under control in the 1890s and was known as the Lushai Hills District, part of Assam.</li>
    <li>After India's independence in 1947, many Mizos began to demand greater autonomy.</li>
    <li>In 1972, Mizoram was made a Union Territory.</li>
    <li>After years of unrest and the signing of the Mizoram Peace Accord in 1986, it became the 23rd state of India on 20 February 1987.</li>
    <li>Since then, Mizoram has grown into a peaceful and vibrant state with strong cultural identity and natural beauty.</li>
