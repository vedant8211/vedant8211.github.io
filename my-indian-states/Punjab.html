    <h2>The Rich History of Punjab</h2>
    
    <p>Punjab, derived from the Persian words 'panj' (five) and 'āb' (water), refers to the land of five rivers: Sutlej, Beas, Ravi, Chenab, and Jhelum. Its rich history spans thousands of years:</p>
    
    <h3>Ancient Period</h3>
    <p>The region of Punjab has been the cradle of one of the world's oldest civilizations - the Indus Valley Civilization (3300-1300 BCE). Archaeological excavations at Ropar, Sanghol, and other sites have revealed sophisticated urban planning and advanced cultural elements. The region finds mention in ancient texts including the Rig Veda.</p>
    
    <h3>Medieval Era</h3>
    <p>Punjab witnessed the rise and fall of numerous dynasties including the Mauryas, Guptas, Kushans, and Mughals. The region was a significant center for trade and culture, attracting merchants and travelers from Central Asia, Persia, and beyond.</p>
    
    <h3>Birth of Sikhism</h3>
    <p>The 15th century marked a transformative period with the birth of Sikhism. Guru Nanak Dev Ji (1469-1539), the first of the ten Sikh Gurus, was born in Talwandi (now Nankana Sahib in Pakistan). The subsequent Gurus shaped Sikhism's principles and established important religious centers in Punjab. The Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib) in Amritsar was established by the fourth Guru, Guru Ram Das Ji, and completed by the fifth Guru, Guru Arjan Dev Ji.</p>
    
    <h3>Sikh Empire</h3>
    <p>In the early 19th century, Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780-1839) unified the Sikh territories and established the powerful Sikh Empire with Lahore as its capital. Known as "Sher-e-Punjab" (Lion of Punjab), his empire extended from the Khyber Pass in the west to Kashmir in the north and to the borders of Delhi in the east.</p>
    
    <h3>British Colonial Period</h3>
    <p>After Ranjit Singh's death, the British annexed Punjab in 1849 following the Second Anglo-Sikh War. Punjab became a province of British India, with significant agricultural development occurring during this period, including the establishment of canal colonies.</p>
    
    <h3>Partition and Independence</h3>
    <p>The Partition of India in 1947 divided Punjab between India and Pakistan along religious lines, resulting in one of history's largest mass migrations and significant bloodshed. Millions of Sikhs and Hindus moved from West Punjab (Pakistan) to East Punjab (India), while Muslims migrated in the opposite direction.</p>
    
    <h3>Post-Independence Era</h3>
    <p>In 1966, Indian Punjab was further divided on linguistic basis to create Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, with Chandigarh becoming a union territory serving as the capital for both Punjab and Haryana. The 1970s-80s saw a period of political unrest known as the Punjabi Suba movement, followed by militancy in the 1980s. Today's Punjab has emerged as one of India's most prosperous states, known for its agricultural productivity and vibrant culture.</p>
