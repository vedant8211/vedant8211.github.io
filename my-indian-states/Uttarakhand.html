    <h2>The Rich History of Uttarakhand</h2>
    
    <p>Uttarakhand, often referred to as "Devbhumi" (Land of Gods), has a rich and ancient history embedded in mythology, spirituality, and cultural heritage:</p>
    
    <h3>Ancient Period</h3>
    <p>The region's history dates back to ancient times, with archaeological evidence suggesting human habitation since prehistoric periods. Uttarakhand finds mention in ancient Hindu texts, including the Vedas, Puranas, and epics like the Mahabharata. According to Hindu mythology, the Pandavas passed through this region on their way to heaven, and many places here are associated with legends of gods and sages.</p>
    
    <p>The region was known as Kedarkhand, Manaskhand, and Himavant in different ancient texts. It was a center of spiritual learning and meditation, with sages and ascetics establishing ashrams throughout the area.</p>
    
    <h3>Medieval Period</h3>
    <p>During the medieval period, the region was divided into two distinct cultural-geographical entities:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Garhwal Kingdom:</strong> Established in the 8th century, the Garhwal region was initially ruled by the Katyuri dynasty. Later, the Panwar dynasty unified the many small fiefdoms and established the Garhwal Kingdom with Srinagar (now in Pauri Garhwal) as its capital.</li>
        <li><strong>Kumaon Kingdom:</strong> The eastern part of Uttarakhand, known as Kumaon, was ruled by the Chand dynasty from the 11th century until the early 19th century, with Champawat and later Almora as their capitals.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Both kingdoms maintained their independence despite invasions and maintained unique cultural traditions that are still practiced today.</p>
    
    <h3>Colonial Period</h3>
    <p>The Gorkha rulers of Nepal invaded and conquered large parts of Garhwal and Kumaon in the late 18th century. However, their rule was short-lived. Following the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814-1816), the British East India Company gained control of the region through the Treaty of Sugauli.</p>
    
    <p>Under British rule, the region was part of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (later renamed Uttar Pradesh after independence). The British established hill stations like Mussoorie, Nainital, and Lansdowne as summer retreats. During this period, the region also saw significant social reforms and the emergence of freedom fighters who contributed to India's independence movement.</p>
    
    <h3>Post-Independence Era and State Formation</h3>
    <p>After India's independence in 1947, the region became part of Uttar Pradesh. However, the cultural, geographical, and developmental differences from the plains led to demands for a separate state. The Uttarakhand movement gained momentum in the 1990s, particularly after the Rampur Tiraha firing incident in 1994, where police fired on protesters.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, on November 9, 2000, Uttarakhand (initially called Uttaranchal; renamed in 2007) was carved out of Uttar Pradesh as India's 27th state. Dehradun was designated as the state's provisional capital, while Gairsain in Chamoli district was declared the summer capital in 2020, fulfilling a long-standing demand.</p>
    
    <p>Since its formation, Uttarakhand has focused on harnessing its tourism potential, preserving its rich cultural heritage, and addressing unique developmental challenges posed by its mountainous geography.</p>
