    <h2>The Rich History of Telangana</h2>
    
    <p>Telangana has a complex and fascinating history that spans several millennia:</p>
    
    <h3>Ancient Period</h3>
    <p>Archaeological findings suggest human habitation in Telangana dates back to Neolithic times. The region was part of various kingdoms including the Mauryas and Satavahanas (230 BCE - 220 CE). The Satavahanas established their capital at Kotilingala in present-day Telangana.</p>
    
    <p>Later, the region came under the rule of the Vakatakas, Vishnukundinas, and the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi. The Kakatiya dynasty (1083-1323 CE) was particularly significant, establishing Warangal (then known as Orugallu) as their capital. Under rulers like Prataparudra II, the Kakatiyas built impressive structures like the Thousand Pillar Temple and Warangal Fort.</p>
    
    <h3>Medieval Period</h3>
    <p>Following the decline of the Kakatiyas after invasions by the Delhi Sultanate, the Musunuri Nayaks briefly restored Hindu rule. By the mid-14th century, the Bahmani Sultanate took control. After its fragmentation, the Qutb Shahi dynasty (1518-1687) established the Golconda Sultanate with Hyderabad as its capital, founded by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah in 1591.</p>
    
    <p>The Qutb Shahis were known for their cultural patronage and architectural contributions, including the iconic Charminar. They were conquered by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1687. In 1724, Asaf Jah I, a Mughal governor, established his independent rule, founding the Asaf Jahi dynasty (Nizams) that would govern the Hyderabad State for over two centuries.</p>
    
    <h3>Colonial Period and Independence</h3>
    <p>While much of India came under direct British rule, Hyderabad State remained a princely state under the Nizams, with the British maintaining indirect control. The last Nizam, Osman Ali Khan, was one of the world's richest men and made significant contributions to education, infrastructure, and culture.</p>
    
    <p>After India's independence in 1947, the Nizam initially resisted joining the Indian Union. The Indian government launched Operation Polo in September 1948, leading to the integration of Hyderabad State into India.</p>
    
    <h3>Post-Independence and Formation of Telangana</h3>
    <p>In 1956, the States Reorganization Act dissolved Hyderabad State, and the Telangana region was merged with Andhra State to form Andhra Pradesh. However, cultural, economic, and political disparities led to calls for a separate state.</p>
    
    <p>After decades of agitation and political movements, Telangana was finally carved out of Andhra Pradesh on June 2, 2014, becoming India's 29th state. K. Chandrashekar Rao became its first Chief Minister, fulfilling the long-standing aspirations of the Telangana people for self-governance.</p>
