        <h2>History of Nagaland</h2>
        <p>
            Nagaland, located in the northeastern part of India, is known for its rich cultural heritage and vibrant tribal traditions. 
            It became the 16th state of India on December 1, 1963. The state is home to 16 major tribes, each with its unique customs, 
            language, and attire. Historically, Nagaland was inhabited by Naga tribes who lived in self-sufficient villages. 
            The region has a history of resistance during British colonial rule and later became a part of independent India.
