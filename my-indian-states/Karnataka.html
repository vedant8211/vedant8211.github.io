  <h1>Welcome to Karnataka</h1>

  <h2>Historical Background</h2>
  <p>
    Karnataka, located in the southwestern region of India, has a rich and vibrant history dating back to prehistoric times. The state was known as the seat of powerful empires such as the <span class="highlight">Kadambas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Hoysalas, and the mighty Vijayanagara Empire</span>. The capital city of the Vijayanagara Empire, Hampi, was once one of the richest cities in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    The region has also seen the rule of the Bahmani Sultanate, Tipu Sultan of Mysore, and later became part of the British Empire until India’s independence in 1947. The modern state of Karnataka was formed in 1956 with the unification of Kannada-speaking regions.
