            Manipur, located in the northeastern part of India, has a rich cultural heritage and a complex history. It was once an independent kingdom known for its strategic location and vibrant culture. The region has seen the influence of various dynasties, including the Ningthouja dynasty, and has been a significant center for the Meitei culture. The state played a crucial role during the Anglo-Manipur War in 1891 and has since been an integral part of India, known for its unique traditions and customs.
