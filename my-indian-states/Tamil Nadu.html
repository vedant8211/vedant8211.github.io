    <h2>The Rich History of Tamil Nadu</h2>
    
    <p>Tamil Nadu's history spans thousands of years, making it one of the oldest civilizations in the world:</p>
    
    <h3>Ancient Period</h3>
    <p>Archaeological evidence suggests human habitation in Tamil Nadu dates back to at least 15,000 BCE, with Neolithic sites discovered at various locations. The region was home to one of the oldest continuous civilizations in the world, collectively known as the Dravidian civilization.</p>
    
    <p>The ancient history of Tamil Nadu is divided into three major periods dominated by powerful dynasties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sangam Period (c. 300 BCE - 300 CE):</strong> Named after the Sangam academies of poets and scholars, this period saw significant cultural and literary development. The Chera, Chola, and Pandya dynasties (collectively known as the Three Crowned Kings - Moovendar) ruled different parts of Tamil Nadu during this time.</li>
        <li><strong>Kalabhra Period (c. 300-600 CE):</strong> A relatively obscure period often referred to as the "Dark Age" in Tamil history.</li>
        <li><strong>Pallava Period (c. 600-900 CE):</strong> The Pallavas ruled from Kanchipuram and were great patrons of art and architecture. They introduced the Dravidian style of temple architecture, evident in the monuments at Mahabalipuram.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Medieval Period</h3>
    <p>The medieval period saw the emergence of more powerful dynasties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chola Empire (c. 850-1279 CE):</strong> The Cholas created one of India's most impressive empires, extending their rule to parts of Southeast Asia. Under rulers like Raja Raja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I, art, architecture, and literature flourished. The magnificent Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur was built during this period.</li>
        <li><strong>Pandya Revival (c. 1216-1345 CE):</strong> The Pandyas reasserted their power after the decline of the Cholas.</li>
        <li><strong>Vijayanagara Empire (1336-1646 CE):</strong> Though centered in present-day Karnataka, this empire controlled parts of Tamil Nadu and protected Hindu traditions during the rise of Islamic powers in North India.</li>
        <li><strong>Nayak Period (c. 1529-1736 CE):</strong> The Nayaks were governors appointed by the Vijayanagara Empire who became independent after its decline. The Madurai Nayaks particularly contributed to Tamil literature, art, and temple architecture.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Colonial Period</h3>
    <p>European powers established trading posts in Tamil Nadu from the 16th century:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Portuguese:</strong> First to arrive, establishing bases at San Thome (Chennai) and Tuticorin.</li>
        <li><strong>Dutch and Danish:</strong> Established trading posts at locations like Pulicat and Tranquebar.</li>
        <li><strong>French:</strong> Controlled Pondicherry (now Puducherry).</li>
        <li><strong>British:</strong> Founded Madras (now Chennai) in 1639. After the Carnatic Wars with the French, the British East India Company gained control of most of Tamil Nadu, which became part of the Madras Presidency.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Modern Period</h3>
    <p>Tamil Nadu played a significant role in India's freedom struggle. C. Rajagopalachari, S. Satyamurti, and V.O. Chidambaram Pillai were prominent freedom fighters from the region. The state also saw a parallel Self-Respect Movement led by Periyar E.V. Ramasamy, which focused on social reform, anti-Brahminism, and Tamil identity.</p>
    
    <p>After India's independence in 1947, the Madras State was formed. Following the States Reorganization Act of 1956, it was reorganized based on linguistic boundaries. In 1969, it was renamed Tamil Nadu ("Land of Tamils") to better reflect its cultural identity.</p>
