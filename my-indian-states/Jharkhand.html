  <h1>History of Jharkhand</h1>
  <p>
    Jharkhand, meaning "The Land of Forests", became the 28th state of India on <strong>November 15, 2000</strong>,
    carved out of the southern part of Bihar. However, the region has a rich history dating back to ancient times.
    It was part of the Magadha Empire and later ruled by various dynasties including the Mauryas and Mughals.
  </p>
  <p>
    The area has always been home to various tribal communities like the Santhals, Mundas, Oraons, and Hos.
    Their resistance movements, especially during British rule, are significant chapters in India’s freedom struggle.
    Notable leaders like <strong>Birsa Munda</strong> led tribal uprisings against British exploitation.
