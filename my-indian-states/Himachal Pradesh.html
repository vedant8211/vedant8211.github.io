    <h1>History of Himachal Pradesh</h1>
    <p>Himachal Pradesh, nestled in the western Himalayas, has a rich and diverse history. In ancient times, it was inhabited by tribes like the Kolis, Dagis, and Dasa. The region finds mention in the sacred texts of the Rigveda and was known to be a part of various ancient empires such as the Mauryas and Guptas.</p>
    <p>During the medieval period, numerous local kingdoms such as the Chamba, Kangra, and Mandi flourished. The British annexed parts of Himachal during the Anglo-Gorkha War (1814–1816), and it later became a part of British India's Punjab Province.</p>
    <p>After India gained independence in 1947, Himachal was formed as a Chief Commissioner's Province. It became a Union Territory in 1950 and was granted full statehood on <strong>January 25, 1971</strong>, becoming the 18th state of India.</p>
