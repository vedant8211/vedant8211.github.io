  <h2>History of Chhattisgarh</h2>

    Chhattisgarh is a state located in central India. It was formed on 1st November 2000 after being carved out of Madhya Pradesh. The name "Chhattisgarh" means "Thirty-Six Forts", though the actual historical number of forts is debated.

    The region has a rich cultural and historical background, with references in ancient scriptures like the Ramayana and Mahabharata. It was once part of the Dakshina Kosala kingdom. During medieval times, it was ruled by local dynasties such as the Kalachuris. Later, the area came under Maratha rule and then the British Empire.

    Today, Chhattisgarh is known for its tribal population, natural resources, and rapid industrial development. It is also rich in minerals, forests, and cultural heritage.
